# Introduction

Hello there!

I'm Aleksei Zhuravlev, I began my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bonn in Winter Semester 2022-2023. 

Here I am collecting all the material that I have generated during the studies. Course related programming assignments, written tasks and lecture notes are organized in respective folders.

# Courses at the University of Bonn

| Name | Description | Semester | Status |
| :---- |:----| :---:|:---:|
| **[Computer Vision<br />I](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/2201_Computer_vision)** | A number of mathematical methods and their applications in computer vision. For example, linear filters, edges, Hough transform, segmentation, active contours, background subtraction, temporal filtering, active appearance models, cameras, 2d/3d features, 3d pose estimation, articulated pose estimation, RGBD vision. | WiSe<br />22-23 | Complete, grade 1.3 |
| **[Technical Neural Networks](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/4204_Technical_Neural_Networks)** | 	Overview over the most important technical neural networks and neural paradigms. The following topics are explained in detail: Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Networks, Back-Propagation of Error, Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning. | WiSe<br />22-23 | Ongoing |
| **[Graph Representation Learning](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/4316_Graph_Representation_Learning)**| General approaches for machine learning on graph structured data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs), graph kernels, as well as graph mining techniques. In the area of graph mining, we will investigate fast (approximate) algorithms to count small patterns, such as triangles, or trees. |WiSe<br />22-23 | Complete, grade 1.3 |
| **[Text Data Mining](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/4316_Graph_Representation_Learning)**| Lecture series on the preliminaries of data mining and machine learning, a deep dive on advanced text mining methods involving Latent Semantic Indexing, Word Embeddings, traditional and resource efficient Recurrent Neural Networks for sequential representations from textual data, Attention Mechanism as well as Transformer architectures. |WiSe<br />22-23 | Ongoing |


# Additional courses

I have also studied several textbooks to improve my fundamental knowledge of algorithms and machine learning.

| Name | Description | Status |
| :---- |:----| :---:|
|**[Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/Introduction_to_algorithms)**| The classic textbook covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. | Implemented fundamental algorithms and data structures |
| **[Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/Hands_on_machine_learning)**| The book uses concrete examples, minimal theory, and production-ready Python frameworks--scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow--to help you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. | Completed most programming assignments |
| **Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell**| Learn how to uncover the hints and hidden details in a question, discover how to break down a problem into manageable chunks, develop techniques to unstick yourself when stuck, learn (or re-learn) core computer science concepts, and practice on 189 interview questions and solutions. | Solved 90% of problems |
